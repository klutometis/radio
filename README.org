A radio player with a little domain knowledge about classical radio
stations; this, for instance, plays its hard-coded domain shufflingly:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./radio.sh
#+END_SRC

this, some caviar:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./radio.sh kusc kqed
#+END_SRC

The =PLAYER= environment variable specifies the player and defaults to
=mplayer -playlist=.
